Practising the DOM Manipulation with Treehouse

This is one of those practice that I do nned to refer back to as this topic covers 
the basic JAVASCRIPT of the DOM Manipulation. This was pretty much the notes I refered to when I was doing the 
Project 7 of the Techdegree. The principle still follows, of course the Project 7 has a lot more especially with the
CSS. 

Note for me to refer to in the future.
